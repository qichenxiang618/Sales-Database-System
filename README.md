## CS6400 GT_Online Sample Project

## Introduction

- Course of this project: CS 6400: Database Systems Concepts and Design course
- Time: Spring 2021
- School: Georgia Institute of Technology
- Program: Online Master of Science in Computer Science

In this project, I designed and implemented a relational sales database with 8 tables using MySQL for a furniture company called Leofurn. The database is designed to store data of the company such as store, order, product, etc. I implemenetd database constraints, such as primary key constraint, foreign key constraint, unique key constraint, etc, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the database. I optimized the database by dividing tables into smaller tables to achieve high normal forms and low data redundancy.

In addition to the database, I also developed a multiple-page and interactive website for the database using PHP. It contains various data reports, allowing users to see data from various perspectives. Some reports allow users to use filters to specify the data they want to see. It also allows users to update some data in the database, such as holiday data and population data.
