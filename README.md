## Leofurn Sales Database System

## Introduction

- Course of this project: CS 6400: Database Systems Concepts and Design (Spring 2021)
- School: Georgia Institute of Technology

In this project, I designed and implemented a relational sales database with 12 tables using MySQL for a furniture company called Leofurn. The database is designed to store various data of the company such as store, order, product, etc. I implemenetd the database constraints, such as primary key constraint, foreign key constraint, unique key constraint, etc, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the database. I optimized the database by dividing tables into smaller tables to achieve high normal forms and low data redundancy.

In addition to the database itself, I also developed a multiple-page and interactive website for the database using PHP. It contains various data reports, allowing users to see data from various perspectives. Some reports allow users to use filters to specify the data they want to see. It also allows users to update some data in the database, such as holiday data and population data.
